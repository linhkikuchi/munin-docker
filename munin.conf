# For the .htaccess file option to work the munin www directory
# (/var/www/html/munin) must have "AllowOverride all" or something close
# to that set.
#
# As a config file enclose it in <directory> like so:

# We could use <IfModule mod_expires> around here, but I want it to be

# Set the default expiery time for files 5 minutes 10 seconds from
# their creation (modification) time.  There are probably new files by
# that time.
